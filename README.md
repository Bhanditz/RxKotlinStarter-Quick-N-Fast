# RxKotlinArms
New kotlin architecture for Android applications developing based on ReactiveX, integrates many open source projects( like Kodein,Rxjava2, RxKotlin, Retrofit... ),to make your developing quicker and easier. 

# View binding
Anko from Kotlin provides a large set of extension for kotlin user to build any views, create intent in fastest way. Also kotlin android binding plugins allows user to use any view without writing 'findViewById' and 'bindView' code. No butterknife or kotterknife library required from now on.

# Runtime permission
RxPermissions provides chaining method for ReactiveX user to grant permission and result response in a single block of code. Annotation-based permission libraries are given up cause they makes huge trouble when gradle build fail, especially when projects go large....

# a lot more, pending.. Under development... Do NOT use.
